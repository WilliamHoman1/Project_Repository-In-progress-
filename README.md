# Project - [SAFEHOME]

For this first milestone, I have created the story behind my game as well as some mechanics to it. I am working on expanding 
my work but for now I am creating the basics. Things like ascii art and sounds are something I am looking forward to incorporating.
I have also created different files for different aspects of the game to make my organization cleaner. I have made the basics for the first scene as well and 
am working on creating the next part.

## Milestone 1

My project for milestone 1 is a text based home invasion game. The player is set up on a storyline and is forced to protect their home 
as well as their life. To do so successfully they are faced with a series of decisions. Each decision made will have an effect on their home
as well as their life. The timing of when they make that decision also matters, either late in the game or early. The user will have complete 
control over their character as well as their destiny.

### Current Progress

The current progress of my project is (just getting started with basics).

### Challenges

My challenges for my project at this stage are creating the classes for each component of the game. The 
complexity and depth of all the options. Also, organizing folders and having the player stay updated throughout 
the decisions.

### Future Directions

My plans for the next milestone is to have more scenes that play through almost the entire game. And to be ready for more additions like sound and art.
As well as more personalization.

## Milestone 2

My project is the home defender game. There is a story line that follows the character depending on the choice's that they make. The goal
is for them to survive as long as possible. And finally defeat the intruder by getting him arrested and wounded. This can be done by acquiring
certain weapons and making the right choices. If they fail to do this, they will be killed by the intruder and have the option to restart. This
is a text-based game that follows a story of an average individual struck by danger.

### Current Progress

The current progress of my game is the welcome message, story line, and options for the character are all set up. I need to complete the rest of 
the scenes and move the story along but the basic format from prototype one is complete. The user can die if they make the wrong choice or currently
keep their journey going if they make the right moves. The user is able to go down many different pathways in order to defeat the intruder and has a wide
variety of options to personalize their story.

### Challenges

Some challenges I have faced is that it takes a good chunk of time to make each new scene. This is because it is all based on user input. I have to make different
story lines based on the choices that the user made. There are a total of 5 choices from the beginning so I have to make 5 different story lines off of that.
Something else I found challenging was carrying over the player across multiple scenes. However, I have figured that out and the players position, stats, and inventory
save across the duration of the game.

### Future Directions

My future plans for this game is to complete all the scenes and once that is done, go back in and add art or music. This would add visual aspects to my game and 
make it even more immersive. Once I have completed the game itself that is when I can add more speciality things like I mentioned before. But, currently the task 
is to finish all the scenes and then go back and make additions. I also want to add a timer for certain attack decision to put pressure on the user to stay engaged.

## Final Submission

### Overview

My project is about a home invasion game where the user is the homeowner and the computer is the invader. The user has to make a series
of decisions in order to survive and beat the game. However, if they make the wrong decision, they are killed and forced to end the game
or start over. There are multiple different paths the user could go down to make the story their own. That is the basis of the game, a 
personalized story for the user and they ultimately decide their fate.

### Tutorial

To start the game, the user will press the play button from the 'main' file. This then pulls up the 
The tutorial should at least be 2 paragraphs long and describe how to get started using the program. For example, if it
is a game then you might want to introduce how to start playing and what the basic controls are. If it is a web
application, you might want to indicate how to navigate the application and interact with different components.

### Installation Instructions

Write instructions here for running your program and any files required to do so as appropriate for your programming
language**. For Python projects, this typically means having a `requirements.txt file` that you create using
“pip freeze > requirements.txt”.
