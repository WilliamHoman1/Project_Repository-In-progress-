# Project - [SAFEHOME]

For this first milestone, I have created the story behind my game as well as some mechanics to it. I am working on expanding 
my work but for now I am creating the basics. Things like ascii art and sounds are something I am looking forward to incorporating.
I have also created different files for different aspects of the game to make my organization cleaner. I have made the basics for the first scene as well and 
am working on creating the next part.

## Milestone 1

My project for milestone 1 is a text based home invasion game. The player is set up on a storyline and is forced to protect their home 
as well as their life. To do so successfully they are faced with a series of decisions. Each decision made will have an effect on their home
as well as their life. The timing of when they make that decision also matters, either late in the game or early. The user will have complete 
control over their character as well as their destiny.

### Current Progress

The current progress of my project is (just getting started with basics).

### Challenges

My challenges for my project at this stage are creating the classes for each component of the game. The 
complexity and depth of all the options. Also, organizing folders and having the player stay updated throughout 
the decisions.

### Future Directions

My plans for the next milestone is to have more scenes that play through almost the entire game. And to be ready for more additions like sound and art.
As well as more personalization.

## Final Submission

### Overview

The overview should be at least a paragraph and describe what your project is about.

### Tutorial

The tutorial should at least be 2 paragraphs long and describe how to get started using the program. For example, if it
is a game then you might want to introduce how to start playing and what the basic controls are. If it is a web
application, you might want to indicate how to navigate the application and interact with different components.

### Installation Instructions

Write instructions here for running your program and any files required to do so as appropriate for your programming
language**. For Python projects, this typically means having a `requirements.txt file` that you create using
“pip freeze > requirements.txt”.

### Citation, Sources, and References

Complete this section to include citations for assets and resources that you used for your project. For example, you could
write this section like in the following example:

```
UI-Pack Sci-FI: https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-sci-fi

Digital Audio Pack: https://kenney.nl/assets/digital-audio

I created by own ASCII art using https://asciiflow.com/#/ and generative AI.
```

Any assets and resources you use need to be verifiable that they are licenced for you to use. If you made your
own assets or used generative AI, you must indicate that you did so. Include a link to any assets that you
downloaded and used. **Leaving this section unedited will count as not having completed it.**
